# Dependency development conventions

## DEP-001 — Keep publication out of ordinary development

- Develop cross-repository changes against source revisions rather than publishing packages to unblock feature work.
- Prefer the repository's declared source-development mechanism. Use a specific revision only when coordinating an unpublished change or reproducing a failure.
- Do not start a crates.io, npm, or other registry release train unless the task is explicitly a release task.

## DEP-002 — Version bumps belong to release work

- Keep package versions compatible during source-development work when possible.
- Put version bumps, changelogs, tags, registry publication, and registry-only consumer updates in a dedicated release change.
- Do not treat a missing published version as a feature blocker when an exact source dependency can prove the change.

## DEP-003 — Bound cross-repository task expansion by ownership

- A normal implementation task may cross repository boundaries when each changed repository owns a necessary part of the same capability or contract.
- Keep the changed source graph as small as the architecture permits and make each repository's responsibility independently explainable and verifiable.
- If implementation starts recursively pulling in unrelated transitive repositories, release work, or opportunistic cleanup, stop the expansion and treat the newly discovered boundary as separate architecture, migration, or follow-up work.
- Do not impose an arbitrary repository-count limit when a coherent change genuinely spans more owners, and do not use a broad task as permission to repair unrelated dependencies.
- When a defect or missing capability belongs to a dependency the workspace owns, fix it in the owning repository and advance the consumer's pin in the same task instead of working around it locally.

## DEP-004 — Require a reason for a new independently versioned package

- Add functionality to an existing coherent package by default.
- Create a new package or crate only when there is a second independent consumer, a hard dependency/isolation boundary, or another concrete reason for independent versioning.
- Conceptual separability alone is not sufficient.

## DEP-005 — Separate development proof from release proof

- Source-mode checks prove that the working source graph is correct.
- Registry-only resolution in a clean checkout is a release/distribution gate, not an inner-loop development gate.
- Before release, remove or deactivate source overrides and prove the published dependency graph independently.

## DEP-006 — Publish frontend packages only for real external consumers

- Keep application-local JavaScript or TypeScript packages source-local.
- Do not publish to npm solely because a workspace package boundary exists.
- Publish only when another independently versioned consumer requires the package or distribution itself is the product.

## DEP-007 — Keep private source graphs local to the coding workspace

- For private cross-repository dependencies, prefer exact sibling repositories or worktrees owned by the outer coding workspace rather than authenticated Git fallback inside the dependency resolver.
- Require each local source checkout to match the exact declared revision before using it; missing or mismatched source must fail explicitly.
- Do not add repository secrets, personal access tokens, or hosted-CI private checkouts merely to reproduce an ordinary multi-repository development workspace.
- Keep hosted CI repository-local when private source access would otherwise be required. Record the exact source revisions and local verification evidence as the implementation proof.
- Authentication may still exist in an explicit release/distribution workflow when that workflow genuinely needs protected release inputs; do not make those credentials a prerequisite for feature development.

## DEP-008 — Keep repository dependencies directional

- Put broadly reusable contracts and primitives below the domain repositories that consume them.
- Domain repositories should depend downward on shared contracts or foundations rather than sideways on another domain's implementation merely to exchange data.
- Put genuine cross-domain behavior in an explicit adapter or composition layer that depends on both domains.
- Applications may compose several domain capabilities directly; that composition is not itself unwanted coupling.

## DEP-009 — Depend on capability surfaces, not upstream topology

- Consume the smallest stable public surface that represents the required capability.
- Do not make callers understand an upstream repository's internal crate/package decomposition when a cohesive public facade or adapter can hide it.
- If ordinary callers must pin or update several same-owner implementation packages together to obtain one capability, improve the owning repository's public boundary instead of spreading that topology into more consumers.
- Do not create a facade that merely forwards APIs without reducing caller knowledge or concentrating compatibility logic.

## DEP-010 — Give every versioned package one canonical owner

- A versioned package or crate must have one canonical repository responsible for source changes, compatibility, tests, and releases.
- During a repository migration, document the temporary old/new ownership state and the exact cutover condition.
- After cutover, the former repository may keep compatibility shims or provenance, but must not remain a competing release or source authority.

## DEP-011 — Treat source overrides as development mechanics

- Exact source overrides may substitute unpublished revisions during cross-repository development, but they must preserve the intended public dependency direction.
- Do not use source patches to normalize permanent sideways dependencies, duplicate ownership, or consumer knowledge of implementation internals.
- Repeated feature work that requires coordinated source heads across several sibling repositories is an architecture signal: introduce or improve a contract, capability surface, adapter, or ownership boundary before expanding the patch graph further.

## DEP-012 — Let maintained dependencies advance

- Applications, internal tooling, and other leaf deliverables may follow current compatible releases without exact version pins. Do not add a fleet-wide exact-version requirement.
- Published libraries declare the narrowest semver-compatible range that truthfully describes the versions consumers may use.
- Repositories may retain lockfiles for repeatable builds, but should update dependencies through their ordinary maintenance path. A lockfile is not a reason to add repeated runner, revision, or dependency-identity verification to every check.

## DEP-013 — Make dependency changes explicit transactions

- Install and verification commands follow the repository's declared dependency strategy. When it uses a committed lockfile, ordinary checks should not silently rewrite it.
- A dependency-manifest change includes the corresponding lockfile change; unexplained lockfile-only changes are not normal feature-work noise.
- Dependency updates use an explicit update command or workflow. Do not run a generic update merely to make dependency resolution or a build start passing.
- Verification should use the ecosystem's frozen/locked mode where available.

## DEP-014 — Keep production dependency graphs acyclic by default

- Production package, module, project, and repository dependency graphs should be acyclic where the ecosystem can model and verify the relationship.
- Test-only, generated, framework-required, or otherwise unavoidable cycles use a narrow explicit exception rather than weakening cycle detection globally.
- Treat a newly introduced cycle as an ownership or boundary problem to resolve, not as normal dependency noise.

## DEP-015 — Centralize automated dependency update policy

- Use Renovate as the canonical routine dependency-update engine for repositories adopting these conventions.
- Keep the shared Renovate policy in this repository's `default.json`; consumer repositories should normally contain only a small `renovate.json` extending `github>moritzbrantner/coding-agent-conventions` plus narrow repository-specific exceptions when genuinely required.
- Keep dependency-update policy in conventions and installation/scaffolding behavior in coding tooling; do not duplicate the policy across repository templates or consumers.
- Ordinary dependency updates run on the shared cadence and limits and automerge only after Renovate sees successful repository checks. Repositories without successful checks remain unmerged, and major updates still require explicit Dependency Dashboard approval.
- Keep GitHub dependency/vulnerability detection available, but do not run overlapping Dependabot version-update PRs after a repository has migrated to Renovate. Existing Dependabot updater configuration must be migrated explicitly rather than deleted implicitly by tooling.

## DEP-016 — Choose distribution by source ownership

- When upstream remains responsible for implementation changes, compatibility, fixes, and releases, consume the capability through the ecosystem's normal package or dependency mechanism.
- When the consumer is expected to own and intentionally customize copied implementation source, use an explicit source-copy contract that records the immutable upstream revision, source-to-target mapping, and content fingerprints in committed provenance metadata.
- Treat consumer-owned copied source as legitimately divergent after installation. Preserve the recorded upstream base so tooling can distinguish clean, modified, and missing files and can reconcile base, local, and newer-upstream content deterministically.
- Use managed snapshots when copied policy, configuration, or generated distribution material remains upstream-owned and consumers should not edit the installed snapshot directly.
- Keep source-copy registries lightweight. Do not grow them into replacement package managers with general version solving, broad transitive dependency semantics, or automatic semantic conflict merging.
- Content fingerprints prove source identity and drift, not runtime or API compatibility; consumer tests, type checks, and benchmarks remain the compatibility gate.

## DEP-017 — Prove dependency ranges as a clean consumer

- Treat the repository's locked development graph, the minimum compatibility point declared by peer ranges, and a fresh registry resolution as three different pieces of evidence.
- Consumer verification for a deterministic compatibility point installs exact versions derived from the package's declared contract rather than floating caret, tilde, or inequality ranges that change meaning over time.
- For publishable packages, use a clean consumer and the real package-manager resolver to prove both the deterministic minimum compatibility point and the current fresh-range resolution before release or distribution integration.
- Do not use `--force`, `--legacy-peer-deps`, or equivalent resolver bypasses as proof that a full consumer dependency graph is valid.
- Registry or network unavailability is an unavailable result, never a passing compatibility result and never evidence that repository code is defective.
- A locked repository graph passing while a clean consumer fails is an explicit distribution-contract finding; repair the verifier or declared peer contract according to the failing boundary instead of weakening resolution.
